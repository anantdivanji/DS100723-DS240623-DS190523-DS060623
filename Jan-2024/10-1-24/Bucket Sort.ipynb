    "# Bucket Sort:\n",
    "- In this algorithm, the items of the list are seperated into multiple groups that are said to be buckets.\n",
    "- Elements in bucket sort are first uniformly divivded into groups called buckets and then they are sorted by using some sorting algorithms\n",
    "- After sorting, the items are gathered in a sorted manner.\n",
    "- The basic procedure for performing bucket sort is as follows\n",
    "- 1. First, partition the range into a fixed number of buckets.\n",
    "  2. Then, toss every element into its appropriate bucket\n",
    "  3. After that, Sort each bucket individually by applying some sorting algorithm\n",
    "  4. And finally, concatenate all the sorted buckets.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "- lst = [10, 8, 20, 7, 16, 18, 12, 1, 23, 11]\n",
    "- Create buckets with a range 0 to 25.\n",
    "- The range can be 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25.\n",
    "- Insert the elements from the list into these buckets.\n",
    "- For example, lets say the value is 16, it should fall into 16-20 bucket range.\n",
    "- Bucket 0-5 : 1\n",
    "- Bucket 6-10 : 8,7\n",
    "- Bucket 11-15 : 10, 12, 11\n",
    "- Bucket 16-20 : 20, 16, 18\n",
    "- Bucket 21-25 : 23\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, sort each bucket individually. The elements of each bucket can be sorted using any of the sorting algorithms.\n",
    "- Bucket 0-5 : 1\n",
    "- Bucket 6-10 : 7,8\n",
    "- Bucket 11-15 : 10, 11, 12\n",
    "- Bucket 16-20 : 16, 18, 20\n",
    "- Bucket 21-25 : 23\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concatenate each bucket to get a sorted list\n",
    "- Sorted list = [1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20, 23]"
